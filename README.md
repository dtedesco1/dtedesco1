Iâ€™m an American in China working to bring humanity closer together. During the day, I work for Google. On nights and weekends, I'm learning all I can about how to use blockchain and AI to make better games. More about me at [dtedes.co](https://dtedes.co).

Join weekly [Community Service Hours](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ta_6tSCGfC31iIfhz4bfC_oBKyNZGEdDsZkD-BRXY_Y/edit#heading=h.6jht9sr0ixk9) with @fulldecent and I, where I often share what what I'm learning about and up to.
